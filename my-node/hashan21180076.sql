If opportunity doesn’t knock, build a door. Navicat provides a wide range advanced features, such as compelling code editing capabilities, smart code-completion, SQL formatting, and more. HTTP Tunneling is a method for connecting to a server that uses the same protocol (http://) and the same port (port 80) as a web server does. Secure SHell (SSH) is a program to log in into another computer over a network, execute commands on a remote server, and move files from one machine to another. Navicat Cloud provides a cloud service for synchronizing connections, queries, model files and virtual group information from Navicat, other Navicat family members, different machines and different platforms.
